# shinyTutorial
In this repository, you find a small tutorial that demonstrates the functionality of Shiny in combination with visNetwork.


## Software Prerequisites

- [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (version >= 1.1.463)
- R (version >= 3.5.2)
- R libraries:
  - [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
  - [visNetwork](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (recommended for reading markdown files offline; not necessary if internet is available)   

The best way to test whether you have necessary libraries is to execute the file `./R/testLibrariesForShiny.R`. If one of the libraries is missing, the script should install them with the `install` command (e.g., `install.packages("shiny")`).


## Tutorial
You can find the actual tutorial [HERE](shinyTutorial.md). The app you will learn to build is available [online](https://floklimm.shinyapps.io/shinyOPIG/).
