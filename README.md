## Software Prerequisites
- Rstudio
- R libraries:
  - shiny
- Atom (recommended for reading markdown files offline)   

The best way to test whether you have necessary libraries is to execute the file `./R/testLibrariesForShiny.R'`. If one of the libraries is missing, install them with the command `install` command (e.g., `install.packages("shiny")`).
