abstract={Most current analysis tools for antibody next-generation sequencing data work with primary sequence descriptors, leaving accompanying structural information unharnessed. We have used novel rapid methods to structurally characterize the paratopes of more than 180 million human and mouse B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequences. These structurally annotated paratopes provide unprecedented insights into both the structural predetermination and dynamics of the adaptive immune response. We show that B-cell types can be distinguished based solely on these structural properties. Antigen-unexperienced BCR repertoires use the highest number and diversity of paratope structures and these patterns of naive repertoire paratope usage are highly conserved across subjects. In contrast, more differentiated B-cells are more personalized in terms of paratope structure usage. Our results establish the paratope structure differences in BCR repertoires and have applications for many fields including immunodiagnostics, phage display library generation, and humanness assessment of BCR repertoires from transgenic animals.},

abstract={The adaptive immune system uses two main types of antigen receptors: T-cell receptors (TCRs) and antibodies. While both proteins share a globally similar β-sandwich architecture, TCRs are specialised to recognise peptide antigens in the binding groove of the major histocompatibility complex, while antibodies can bind an almost infinite range of molecules. For both proteins, the main determinants of target recognition are the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops. Five of the six CDRs adopt a limited number of backbone conformations, known as the ′canonical classes′ ; the remaining CDR (β3 in TCRs and H3 in antibodies) is more structurally diverse. In this paper, we first update the definition of canonical forms in TCRs, build an auto-updating sequence-based prediction tool (available at http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/resources) and demonstrate its application on large scale sequencing studies. Given the global similarity of TCRs and antibodies, we then examine the structural similarity of their CDRs. We find that TCR and antibody CDRs tend to have different length distributions, and where they have similar lengths, they mostly occupy distinct structural spaces. In the rare cases where we found structural similarity, the underlying sequence patterns for the TCR and antibody version are different. Finally, where multiple structures have been solved for the same CDR sequence, the structural variability in TCR loops is higher than that in antibodies, suggesting TCR CDRs are more flexible. These structural differences between TCR and antibody CDRs may be important to their different biological functions.},

abstract={Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have allowed researchers to explore transcriptional function at a cellular level. In this study, we present scPPIN, a method for integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data with protein-protein interaction networks to detect active modules in cells of different transcriptional states. We achieve this by clustering RNA-sequencing data, identifying differentially expressed genes, constructing node-weighted protein-protein interaction networks, and finding the maximum-weight connected subgraphs with an exact Steiner-tree approach. As a case study, we investigate RNA-sequencing data from human liver spheroids but the techniques described here are applicable to other organisms and tissues. scPPIN allows us to expand the output of differential expressed genes analysis with information from protein interactions. We find that different transcriptional states have different subnetworks of the PPIN significantly enriched which represent biological pathways. In these pathways, scPPIN also identifies proteins that are not differentially expressed but of crucial biological function (e.g., as receptors) and therefore reveals biology beyond a standard differentially expressed gene analysis.},

@article{Chonofsky2019,
abstract={Over the last few years, the field of protein structure prediction has been transformed by increasingly-accurate contact prediction software. These methods are based on the detection of coevolutionary relationships between residues from multiple sequence alignments. However, despite speculation, there is little evidence of a link between contact prediction and the physico-chemical interactions which drive amino-acid coevolution. Furthermore, existing protocols predict only a fraction of all protein contacts and it is not clear why some contacts are favoured over others.

Using a dataset of 863 protein domains, we assessed the physico-chemical interactions of contacts predicted by CCMpred, MetaPSICOV, and DNCON2, as examples of direct coupling analysis, meta-prediction, and deep learning, respectively. To further investigate what sets these predicted contacts apart, we considered correctly-predicted contacts and compared their properties against the protein contacts that were not predicted.

We found that predicted contacts tend to form more bonds than non-predicted contacts, which suggests these contacts may be more important. Comparing the contacts predicted by each method, we found that metaPSICOV and DNCON2 favour accuracy whereas CCMPred detects contacts with more bonds. This suggests that the push for higher accuracy may lead to a loss of physico-chemically important contacts.

These results underscore the connection between protein physico-chemistry and the coevolutionary couplings that can be derived from multiple sequence alignments. This relationship is likely to be relevant to protein structure prediction and functional analysis of protein structure and may be key to understanding their utility for different problems in structural biology.},

abstract = {While template-free protein structure prediction protocols now produce good quality models for many targets, modelling failure remains common. For these methods to be useful it is important that users can both choose the best model from the hundreds to thousands of models that are commonly generated for a target, and determine whether this model is likely to be correct. We have developed Random Forest Quality Assessment (RFQAmodel), which assesses whether models produced by a protein structure prediction pipeline have the correct fold. RFQAmodel uses a combination of existing quality assessment scores with two predicted contact map alignment scores. These alignment scores are able to identify correct models for targets that are not otherwise captured. Our classifier was trained on a large set of protein domains that are structurally diverse and evenly balanced in terms of protein features known to have an effect on modelling success, and then tested on a second set of 244 protein domains with a similar spread of properties. When models for each target in this second set were ranked according to the RFQAmodel score, the highest-ranking model had a high-confidence RFQAmodel score for 67 modelling targets, of which 52 had the correct fold. At the other end of the scale RFQAmodel correctly predicted that for 59 targets the highest-ranked model was incorrect. In comparisons to other methods we found that RFQAmodel is better able to identify correct models for targets where only a few of the models are correct. We found that RFQAmodel achieved a similar performance on the model sets for CASP12 and CASP13 free-modelling targets. Finally, by iteratively generating models and running RFQAmodel until a model is produced that is predicted to be correct with high confidence, we demonstrate how such a protocol can be used to focus computational efforts on difficult modelling targets.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental assumptions of fragment-based drug discovery is that the fragment’s binding mode will be conserved upon elaboration into larger compounds. The most common way of quantifying binding mode similarity is Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), but Protein Ligand Interaction Fingerprint (PLIF) similarity and shape-based metrics are sometimes used. We introduce SuCOS, an open-source shape and chemical feature overlap metric. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of RMSD, PLIF similarity, and SuCOS on a dataset of X-ray crystal structures of paired elaborated larger and smaller molecules bound to the same protein. Our redocking and cross-docking studies show that SuCOS is superior to RMSD and PLIF similarity. When redocking, SuCOS produces fewer false positives and false negatives than RMSD and PLIF similarity; and in cross-docking, SuCOS is better at differentiating experimentally-observed binding modes of an elaborated molecule given the pose of its non-elaborated counterpart. Finally we show that SuCOS performs better than AutoDock Vina at differentiating actives from decoy ligands using the DUD-E dataset. SuCOS is available at https://github.com/susanhleung/SuCOS.},

The maturation of the B-cell system through continuous antigen exposure with age is poorly studied. We extensively investigated naïve and antigen-experienced B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in individuals aged 6 months to 50 years. Most dynamics were observed in the first 10 years of life characterized by an increase in frequencies of mutated transcripts through positive selection, increased usage of downstream constant region genes and a decrease in the frequency of transcripts with self-reactive properties. Structural analysis revealed that the frequency of antibodies different from germline in shape increased with age.

@article{Bozhilova2019,
abstract = {Background: Protein interaction databases often provide confidence scores for each recorded interaction based on the available experimental evidence. Protein interaction networks (PINs) are then built by thresholding on these scores, so that only interactions of sufficiently high quality are included. These networks are used to identify biologically relevant motifs or nodes using metrics such as degree or betweenness centrality. This type of analysis can be sensitive to the choice of threshold. If a node metric is to be useful for extracting biological signal, it should induce similar node rankings across PINs obtained at different reasonable confidence score thresholds. Results: We propose three measures---rank continuity, identifiability, and instability---to evaluate how robust a node metric is to changes in the score threshold. We apply our measures to twenty-five metrics and identify four as the most robust: the number of edges in the step-1 ego network, as well as the leave-one-out differences in average redundancy, average number of edges in the step-1 ego network, and natural connectivity. Our measures show good agreement across PINs from different species and data sources. Analysis of synthetically generated scored networks shows that robustness results are context-specific, and depend both on network topology and on how scores are placed across network edges. Conclusion: Due to the uncertainty associated with protein interaction detection, and therefore network structure, for PIN analysis to be reproducible, it should yield similar results across different confidence score thresholds. We demonstrate that while certain node metrics are robust with respect to threshold choice, this is not always the case. Promisingly, our results suggest that there are some metrics that are robust across networks constructed from different databases, and different scoring procedures.},

abstract = {Machine learning scoring functions for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction have been found to consistently outperform classical scoring functions. Structure-based scoring functions for universal affinity prediction typically use features describing interactions derived from the protein-ligand complex, with limited information about the chemical or topological properties of the ligand itself. We demonstrate that the performance of machine learning scoring functions are consistently improved by the inclusion of diverse ligand-based features. For example, a Random Forest combining the features of RF-Score v3 with RDKit molecular descriptors achieved Pearson correlation coefficients of up to 0.831, 0.785, and 0.821 on the PDBbind 2007, 2013, and 2016 core sets respectively, compared to 0.790, 0.737, and 0.797 when using the features of RF-Score v3 alone. Excluding proteins and/or ligands that are similar to those in the test sets from the training set has a significant effect on scoring function performance, but does not remove the predictive power of ligand-based features. Furthermore a Random Forest using only ligand-based features is predictive at a level similar to classical scoring functions and it appears to be predicting the mean binding affinity of a ligand for its protein targets.},

abstract={Kinase structures in the inactive “DFG‐out” state provide a wealth of druggable binding site variants. The conformational plasticity of this state can be mainly described by different conformations of binding site‐forming elements such as DFG motif, A‐loop, P‐loop, and αC‐helix. Compared to DFG‐in structures, DFG‐out structures are largely underrepresented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Thus, structure‐based drug design efforts for DFG‐out inhibitors may benefit from an efficient approach to generate an ensemble of DFG‐out structures. Accordingly, the presented modeling pipeline systematically generates homology models of kinases in several DFG‐out conformations based on a sophisticated creation of template structures that represent the major states of the flexible structural elements. Eighteen template classes were initially selected from all available kinase structures in the PDB and subsequently employed for modeling the entire kinome in different DFG‐out variants by fusing individual structural elements to multiple chimeric template structures. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that conformational transitions between the different DFG‐out states generally do not occur within trajectories of a few hundred nanoseconds length. This underlines the benefits of the presented homology modeling pipeline to generate relevant conformations of “DFG‐out” kinase structures for subsequent in silico screening or binding site analysis studies.},

abstract = {We present Ligity: a hybrid ligand-structure-based, non-superpositional method for virtual screening of large databases of small molecules. Ligity uses the relative spatial distribution of Pharmacophoric Interaction Points (PIPs) derived from the conformations of small molecules. These are compared with the PIPs derived from key interaction features found in protein-ligand complexes, and are used to prioritize likely binders. We investigated the effect of: generating PIPs using a single lowest energy conformer versus an ensemble of conformers for each screened ligand; different bin sizes for the distance between two features; the use of triangular sets of pharmacophoric features (3-PIPs) versus chiral tetrahedral sets (4-PIPs); data fusion for targets with multiple protein-ligand complex structures; and different similarity measures. Ligity was benchmarked using the Directory of Useful Decoys Enhanced (DUD-E). Optimal results were obtained using the tetrahedral PIPs derived from an ensemble of bound ligand conformers and a bin size of 1.5 Å, which are used as the default settings for Ligity. The high-throughput screening (HTS) mode of Ligity, using only the lowest-energy conformer of each ligand, was used for benchmarking against the whole of DUD-E, and a more resource-intensive, ‘information-rich’ mode of Ligity, using a conformational ensemble of each ligand, was used for a representative subset of ten targets. Against the full DUD-E database, mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.44 to 0.99, while for the representative subset, they ranged from 0.61 to 0.86. Data fusion further improved Ligity’s performance, with mean AUC values ranging from 0.64 to 0.95. Ligity is very efficient compared to a protein-ligand docking method such as AutoDock Vina: if the time taken for the pre-calculation of Ligity descriptors is included in the comparison then Ligity is about 20 times faster than docking. A direct comparison of the virtual screening steps shows Ligity to be over 5,000 times faster. Ligity ranks highly the lowest-energy conformers of DUD-E actives, in a statistically significant manner, behaviour that is not observed for DUD-E decoys. Thus, our results suggest that active compounds tend to bind in relatively low-energy conformations compared to decoys. This may be because actives — and thus their lowest-energy conformations — have been optimized for conformational complementarity with their cognate binding sites.},

Energetic difference, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and torsion fingerprint deviation (TFD) are used to quantify differences between the conformer search algorithms. In general, we find BOA requires far fewer evaluations than systematic or uniform random search to find low-energy minima. For molecules with four or more rotatable bonds, Confab typically evaluates 104 (median) conformers in its search, while BOA only requires 102 energy evaluations to find top candidates.

While small-molecule drug discovery benefits from Lipinski’s rule of five to guide the selection of molecules with appropriate biophysical properties, there is currently no in silico analog for antibody design. Here, we model the variable domain structures of a large set of post-phase-I clinical-stage antibody therapeutics (CSTs) and calculate in silico metrics to estimate their typical properties. In each case, we contextualize the CST distribution against a snapshot of the human antibody gene repertoire. We describe guideline values for five metrics thought to be implicated in poor developability: the total length of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), the extent and magnitude of surface hydrophobicity, positive charge and negative charge in the CDRs, and asymmetry in the net heavy- and light-chain surface charges. The guideline cutoffs for each property were derived from the values seen in CSTs, and a flagging system is proposed to identify nonconforming candidates. On two mAb drug discovery sets, we were able to selectively highlight sequences with developability issues.

This is especially true for long loops where the large conformational space and limited coverage of experimentally-determined structures often leads to low accuracy. Co-evolutionary contact predictors, which provide information about the proximity of pairs of residues, have been used to improve whole-protein models generated through de novo techniques. Here we investigate whether these evolutionary constraints can enhance the prediction of long loop structures. Results. As a first stage, we assess the accuracy of predicted contacts that involve loop regions. We find that these are less accurate than contacts in general. We also observe that some incorrectly-predicted contacts can be identified as they are never satisfied in any of our generated loop conformations. We examined two different strategies for incorporating contacts, and on a test set of long loops (ten residues or more), both approaches improve the accuracy of prediction. For a set of 135 loops, contacts were predicted and hence our methods were applicable in 97 cases. Both strategies result in an increase in the proportion of near-native decoys in the ensemble, leading to more accurate predictions and in some cases improving the RMSD of the final model by more than 3 Å.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing of the Ig gene repertoire (Ig-seq) produces large volumes of information at the nucleotide sequence level. Such data have improved our understanding of immune systems across numerous species and have already been successfully applied in vaccine development and drug discovery. However, the high-throughput nature of Ig-seq means that it is afflicted by high error rates. This has led to the development of error-correction approaches. Computational error-correction methods use sequence information alone, primarily designating sequences as likely to be correct if they are observed frequently. In this work, we describe an orthogonal method for filtering Ig-seq data, which considers the structural viability of each sequence. A typical natural Ab structure requires the presence of a disulfide bridge within each of its variable chains to maintain the fold. Our Ab Sequence Selector (ABOSS) uses the presence/absence of this bridge as a way of both identifying structurally viable sequences and estimating the sequencing error rate. On simulated Ig-seq datasets, ABOSS is able to identify more than 99% of structurally viable sequences. Applying our method to six independent Ig-seq datasets (one mouse and five human), we show that our error calculations are in line with previous experimental and computational error estimates. We also show how ABOSS is able to identify structurally impossible sequences missed by other error-correction methods.},

abstract = {Molecular simulations are a computational technique used to investigate the dynamics of proteins and other molecules. The solution landscape of these simulations is often rugged and minor differences in the initial seed, floating point precision, or underlying hardware can cause identical simulations (replicas) to take different paths in the landscape. In this study we investigated the magnitude of these effects based on 310 000 ns of simulation time. We performed 100 identically parameterised replicas of 3000 ns each for a small 10 amino acid system as well as 100 identically parameterised replicas of 100 ns each for an 827 residue T-cell receptor / MHC system. Comparing randomly chosen subgroups within these replica sets we estimate the reproducibility and reliability that can be achieved by a given number of replicas at a given simulation time. These results demonstrate that conclusions drawn from single simulations are often not reproducible and that conclusions drawn from multiple shorter replicas are more reliable than those from a single longer simulation. The actual number of replicas needed will always depend on the question asked and the level of reliability sought. Based on our data it appears a good rule of thumb is to perform a minimum of five to ten replicas.},

The lack of understanding of complex dependencies among network characteristics makes it difficult to fully understand the meaning of the different network comparison methodologies and the relations between them. In this article, we use a Monte Carlo framework as a way to address three general questions about the network comparison methods based on subgraph counts: (1) Can the methods differentiate between networks generated from different network generation mechanisms? (2) Are the number of nodes or average degree, confounding factors for the comparison of networks? (3) Do all methods reach the same conclusions? We further use the Monte Carlo framework to test the fit of ER, Chung-Lu and a duplication–divergence model to the protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of Yeast, Fly, Worm, Human, Escherichia Coli, five herpes virus networks and five social networks. In contrast to previous claims in the literature, we show that the large PPI networks are not well modelled by the Chung-Lu model according to any of our tested methods. We find that network comparison statistics are not completely invariant to changes in the number of nodes and edges. Some methods focus on fine grain similarities, such as graphlet correlation distance, while other methods such as Netdis, can capture the similarities of networks despite them having different numbers of nodes and edges.},

Their sequence diversity and binding versatility have made antibodies the primary class of biopharmaceuticals. Recently it has become possible to query their immense natural diversity using next-generation sequencing of immunoglobulin gene repertoires (Ig-seq). However, Ig-seq outputs are currently fragmented across repositories and tend to be presented as raw nucleotide reads, which means nontrivial effort is required to reuse the data for analysis. To address this issue, we have collected Ig-seq outputs from 53 studies, covering more than half a billion antibody sequences across diverse immune states, organisms and individuals. We have sorted, cleaned, annotated, translated and numbered these sequences and make the data available via our Observed Antibody Space (OAS) resource at antibodymap.org. The data within OAS will be regularly updated with newly released Ig-seq datasets. We believe OAS will facilitate data mining of immune repertoires for improved understanding of the immune system and development of better biotherapeutics.},

abstract = {Motivated by a cutting edge problem related to the shape of alpha-helices in proteins, we formulate a parametric statistical model, which incorporates the cylindrical nature of the helix. Our focus is to detect a “kink,” which is a drastic change in the axial direction of the helix. We propose a statistical model for the straight alpha-helix and derive the maximum likelihood estimation procedure. The cylinder is an accepted geometric model for alpha-helices, but our statistical formulation, for the first time, quantifies the uncertainty in atom positions around the cylinder. We propose a change point technique “Kink-Detector” to detect a kink location along the helix. Unlike classical change point problems, the change in direction of a helix depends on a simultaneous shift of multiple data points rather than a single data point, and is less straightforward. Our biological building block is crowdsourced data on straight and kinked helices; which has set a gold standard. We use this data to identify salient features to construct Kink-Detector, test its performance and gain some insights. We find the performance of Kink-Detector comparable to its computational competitor called “Kink-Finder.” We highlight that identification of kinks by visual assessment can have limitations and Kink-Detector may help in such cases. Further, an analysis of crowdsourced curved alpha-helices finds that Kink-Detector is also effective in detecting moderate changes in axial directions.},

Current antibody modelling tools use backbone–dependent rotamer libraries with conformations taken from general proteins. Here we present our antibody–specific rotamer library, where rotamers are binned according to their IMGT position, rather than their local backbone geometry. We find that for some amino acid types at certain positions, only a restricted number of side chain conformations are ever observed. Using this information, we are able to reduce the breadth of the rotamer sampling space. Based on our rotamer library, we built a side chain predictor, PEARS. On a blind test set of 95 antibody model structures, PEARS had the highest average ϰ1 and ϰ1 + 2 accuracy (78.7{\%} and 64.8{\%}) compared to three leading backbone–dependent side chain predictors. Our use of IMGT position, rather than backbone ϕ/$\psi$, meant that PEARS was more robust to errors in the backbone of the model structure. PEARS also achieved the lowest number of side chain–side chain clashes. PEARS is freely available as a web application at http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/pears.

Structure prediction algorithms need to be able to model these different conformations accurately and produce an ensemble of structures that represent a target’s conformational diversity rather than just a single state. Here, we investigate whether current loop prediction algorithms are capable of this. We use the algorithms to predict the structures of loops with multiple experimentally determined conformations, and the structures of loops with only one conformation, and assess their ability to generate and select decoys that are close to any, or all, of the observed structures.
Results. We find that while loops with only one known conformation are predicted well, conformationally diverse loops are modelled poorly, and in most cases the predictions returned by the methods do not resemble any of the known conformers. Our results contradict the often-held assumption that multiple native conformations will be present in the decoy set, making the production of accurate conformational ensembles impossible, and hence indicating that current methodologies are not well suited to prediction of conformationally diverse, often functionally important protein regions.

abstract = {Motivation: Most current de novo structure prediction methods randomly sample protein conformations and thus require large amounts of computational resource. Here, we consider a sequential sampling strategy, building on ideas from recent experimental work which shows that many proteins fold cotranslationally. Results: We have investigated whether a pseudo-greedy search approach, which begins sequentially from one of the termini, can improve the performance and accuracy of de novo protein structure prediction. We observed that our sequential approach converges when fewer than 20,000 decoys have been produced, fewer than commonly expected. Using our software, SAINT2, we also compared the run time and quality of models produced in a sequential fashion against a standard, non-sequential approach. Sequential prediction produces an individual decoy 1.5 to 2.5 times faster than non-sequential prediction. When considering the quality of the best model, sequential prediction led to a better model being produced for 31 out of 41 soluble protein validation cases and for 18 out of 24 transmembrane protein cases. Correct models (TM-Score {\textgreater} 0.5) were produced for 29 of these cases by the sequential mode and for only 22 by the non-sequential mode. Our comparison reveals that a sequential search strategy can be used to drastically reduce computational time of de novo protein structure prediction and improve accuracy.

Such contact predictors have been compared in terms of the precision of their predictions, but there is no study that compares their usefulness to model generation. Results. We compared eight different co-evolution methods for a set of ∼3500 proteins and found that metaPSICOV stage 2 produces, on average, the most precise predictions. Precision of all the methods is dependent on SCOP class, with most methods predicting contacts in all α and membrane proteins poorly. The contact predictions were then used to assist in de novo model generation. We found that it was not the method with the highest average precision, but rather metaPSICOV stage 1 predictions that consistently led to the best models being produced. Our modelling results show a correlation between the proportion of predicted long range contacts that are satisfied on a model and its quality. We used this proportion to effectively classify models as correct/incorrect; discarding decoys classified as incorrect led to an enrichment in the proportion of good decoys in our final ensemble by a factor of seven. For 17 out of the 18 cases where correct answers were generated, the best models were not discarded by this approach. We were also able to identify eight cases where no correct decoy had been generated.},

The method is based on enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics calculations in combination with a continuum solvent approximation and includes estimates of the configurational entropy based on either a one or a three trajectory protocol. It produces precise and reproducible free energy estimates which correlate well with experimental measurements. If the results are combined with an amino acid hydrophobicity scale, then an extremely good ranking of peptide binding affinities emerges. Our approach is rapid, robust, and applicable to a wide range of ligand–receptor interactions without further adjustment.},

abstract = {Fragment-based approaches are the current standard for de novo protein structure prediction. These approaches rely on accurate and reliable fragment libraries to generate good structural models. In this work, we describe a novel method for structure fragment library generation and its application in fragment-based de novo protein structure prediction. The importance of correct testing procedures in assessing the quality of fragment libraries is demonstrated. In particular, the exclusion of homologs to the target from the libraries to correctly simulate a de novo protein structure prediction scenario, something which surprisingly is not always done. We demonstrate that fragments presenting different predominant predicted secondary structures should be treated differently during the fragment library generation step and that exhaustive and random search strategies should both be used. This information was used to develop a novel method, Flib. On a validation set of 41 structurally diverse proteins, Flib libraries presents both a higher precision and coverage than two of the state-of-the-art methods, NNMake and HHFrag. Flib also achieves better precision and coverage on the set of 275 protein domains used in the two previous experiments of the the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP9 and CASP10). We compared Flib libraries against NNMake libraries in a structure prediction context. Of the 13 cases in which a correct answer was generated, Flib models were more accurate than NNMake models for 10. “Flib is available for download at: http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/research/proteins/resources”.},

abstract = {Several protein structure classification schemes exist that partition the protein universe into structural units called folds. Yet these schemes do not discuss how these units sit relative to each other in a global structure space. In this paper we construct networks that describe such global relationships between folds in the form of structural bridges. We generate these networks using four different structural alignment methods across multiple score thresholds. The networks constructed using the different methods remain a similar distance apart regardless of the probability threshold defining a structural bridge. This suggests that at least some structural bridges are method specific and that any attempt to build a picture of structural space should not be reliant on a single structural superposition method. Despite these differences all representations agree on an organisation of fold space into five principal community structures: all-$\alpha$, all-$\beta$ sandwiches, all-$\beta$ barrels, $\alpha$/$\beta$ and $\alpha$ + $\beta$. We project estimated fold ages onto the networks and find that not only are the pairings of unconnected folds associated with higher age differences than bridged folds, but this difference increases with the number of networks displaying an edge. We also examine different centrality measures for folds within the networks and how these relate to fold age. While these measures interpret the central core of fold space in varied ways they all identify the disposition of ancestral folds to fall within this core and that of the more recently evolved structures to provide the peripheral landscape. These findings suggest that evolutionary information is encoded along these structural bridges. Finally, we identify four highly central pivotal folds representing dominant topological features which act as key attractors within our landscapes.},

@article{Kashir2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:

Male factor and idiopathic infertility contribute significantly to global infertility, with abnormal testicular gene expression considered to be a major cause. Certain types of male infertility are caused by failure of the sperm to activate the oocyte, a process normally regulated by calcium oscillations, thought to be induced by a sperm-specific phospholipase C, PLCzeta (PLCζ). Previously, we identified a point mutation in an infertile male resulting in the substitution of histidine for proline at position 398 of the protein sequence (PLCζ(H398P)), leading to abnormal PLCζ function and infertility.
METHODS AND RESULTS:

Here, using a combination of direct-sequencing and mini-sequencing of the PLCζ gene from the patient and his family, we report the identification of a second PLCζ mutation in the same patient resulting in a histidine to leucine substitution at position 233 (PLCζ(H233L)), which is predicted to disrupt local protein interactions in a manner similar to PLCζ(H398P) and was shown to exhibit abnormal calcium oscillatory ability following predictive 3D modelling and cRNA injection in mouse oocytes respectively. We show that PLCζ(H233L) and PLCζ(H398P) exist on distinct parental chromosomes, the former inherited from the patient's mother and the latter from his father. Neither mutation was detected utilizing custom-made single-nucleotide polymorphism assays in 100 fertile males and females, or 8 infertile males with characterized oocyte activation deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS:

Collectively, our findings provide further evidence regarding the importance of PLCζ at oocyte activation and forms of male infertility where this is deficient. Additionally, we show that the inheritance patterns underlying male infertility are more complex than previously thought and may involve maternal mechanisms.},

We describe the residue-specific methylation of E2F-1 by the asymmetric dimethylating protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 1 and symmetric dimethylating PRMT5, and relate the marks to different functional consequences of E2F-1 activity. Methylation by PRMT1 hinders methylation by PRMT5, which augments E2F-1-dependent apoptosis, whereas PRMT5-dependent methylation favours proliferation by antagonising methylation by PRMT1. The ability of E2F-1 to prompt apoptosis in DNA damaged cells coincides with enhanced PRMT1 methylation. In contrast, cyclin A binding to E2F-1 impedes PRMT1 methylation and augments PRMT5 methylation, thus ensuring that E2F-1 is locked into its cell cycle progression mode. The Tudor domain protein p100-TSN reads the symmetric methylation mark, and binding of p100-TSN down-regulates E2F-1 apoptotic activity. Our results define an exquisite level of precision in the reader-writer interplay that governs the biological outcome of E2F-1 activity.},

abstract = {Motivation: A wealth of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has recently become available. These data are organized as PPI networks and an efficient and biologically meaningful method to compare such PPI networks is needed. As a first step, we would like to compare observed networks to established network models, under the aspect of small subgraph counts, as these are conjectured to relate to functional modules in the PPI network. We employ the software tool GraphCrunch with the Graphlet Degree Distribution Agreement (GDDA) score to examine the use of such counts for network comparison., Results: Our results show that the GDDA score has a pronounced dependency on the number of edges and vertices of the networks being considered. This should be taken into account when testing the fit of models. We provide a method for assessing the statistical significance of the fit between random graph models and biological networks based on non-parametric tests. Using this method we examine the fit of Erd{\"{o}}s���R{\'{e}}nyi (ER), ER with fixed degree distribution and geometric (3D) models to PPI networks. Under these rigorous tests none of these models fit to the PPI networks. The GDDA score is not stable in the region of graph density relevant to current PPI networks. We hypothesize that this score instability is due to the networks under consideration having a graph density in the threshold region for the appearance of small subgraphs. This is true for both geometric (3D) and ER random graph models. Such threshold behaviour may be linked to the robustness and efficiency properties of the PPI networks., Contact: tiago@stats.ox.ac.uk, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Motivation: Template-based modelling can approximate the unknown structure of a target protein using an homologous template structure. The core of the resulting prediction then comprises the structural regions conserved between template and target. Target prediction could be improved by rigidly repositioning such single template, structurally conserved fragment regions. The purpose of this article is to quantify the extent to which such improvements are possible and to relate this extent to properties of the target, the template and their alignment.
Results: The improvement in accuracy achievable when rigid fragments from a single template are optimally positioned was calculated using structure pairs from the HOMSTRAD database, as well as CASP7 and CASP8 target/best template pairs. Over the union of the structurally conserved regions, improvements of 0.7 {\AA} in root mean squared deviation (RMSD) and 6% in GDT_HA were commonly observed. A generalized linear model revealed that the extent to which a template can be improved can be predicted using four variables. Templates with the greatest scope for improvement tend to have relatively more fragments, shorter fragments, higher percentage of helical secondary structure and lower sequence identity. Optimal positioning of the template fragments offers the potential for improving loop modelling. These results demonstrate that substantial improvement could be made on many templates if the conserved fragments were to be optimally positioned. They also provide a basis for identifying templates for which modification of fragment positions may yield such improvements.

abstract = {Protein interactions play a vital part in the function of a cell. As experimental techniques for detection and validation of protein interactions are time consuming, there is a need for computational methods for this task. Protein interactions appear to form a network with a relatively high degree of local clustering. In this paper we exploit this clustering by suggesting a score based on triplets of observed protein interactions. The score utilises both protein characteristics and network properties. Our score based on triplets is shown to complement existing techniques for predicting protein interactions, outperforming them on data sets which display a high degree of clustering. The predicted interactions score highly against test measures for accuracy. Compared to a similar score derived from pairwise interactions only, the triplet score displays higher sensitivity and specificity. By looking at specific examples, we show how an experimental set of interactions can be enriched and validated. As part of this work we also examine the effect of different prior databases upon the accuracy of prediction and find that the interactions from the same kingdom give better results than from across kingdoms, suggesting that there may be fundamental differences between the networks. These results all emphasize that network structure is important and helps in the accurate prediction of protein interactions.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: At present there exists no age estimate for the different protein structures found in nature. It has become clear from occurrence studies that different folds arose at different points in evolutionary time. An estimation of the age of different folds would be a starting point for many investigations into protein structure evolution: how we arrived at the set of folds we see today. It would also be a powerful tool in protein structure classification allowing us to reassess the available hierarchical methods and perhaps suggest improvements.
RESULTS: We have created the first relative age estimation technique for protein folds. Our method is based on constructing parsimonious scenarios, which can describe occurrence patterns in a phylogeny of species. The ages presented are shown to be robust to the different trees or data types used for their generation. They show correlations with other previously used protein age estimators, but appear to be far more discriminating than any previously suggested technique. The age estimates given are not absolutes but they already offer intriguing insights, like the very different age patterns of alpha/beta folds compared with small folds. The alpha/beta folds appear on average to be far older than their small fold counterparts.

The databases facilitate the recognition of a family or superfamily, they assist in the selection of useful parent structures, they are helpful in alignment of the target sequences with the parent set, and are useful for deriving relationships that can be used in validating models. In the iterative approach, a model is constructed on the basis of the proposed sequence alignment and this is then reexpressed in the JOY format and realigned with the parent set. This is repeated until the model and sequence alignment is optimized. We examine the case for comparison and use of multiple structures of family members, rather than a single parent structure.

RESULTS: The algorithm SCORE steps away from the conventional definitions of the core to identify from large numbers of basis structures those regions that can be considered structurally related to a target sequence. The use of phi, psi constraints to accurately pinpoint the regions that are conserved across a family and environmentally constrained substitution tables to extend these regions allows SCORE to rapidly (generally in under 1 s, an order of magnitude faster than methods such as MODELLER) identify and build the core of homology models from the alignments of the target sequence to the basis structures. The SCORE algorithm was used to build 114 model cores. In only two cases was the core size less than 50% of the structure and all the cores built had an RMSD of 3.7 A or less to the target structure.},

Here we consider whether membrane proteins undergo different substitutions from their soluble counterparts and whether these can be used to improve membrane protein alignments, and therefore improve prediction of their structure.

RESULTS: We construct substitution tables for different environments within membrane proteins. As data is scarce, we develop a general metric to assess the quality of these asymmetric tables. Membrane proteins show markedly different substitution preferences from soluble proteins. For example, substitution preferences in lipid tail-contacting parts of membrane proteins are found to be distinct from all environments in soluble proteins, including buried residues. A principal component analysis of the tables identifies the greatest variation in substitution preferences to be due to changes in hydrophobicity; the second largest variation relates to secondary structure. We demonstrate the use of our tables in pairwise sequence-to-structure alignments (also known as 'threading') of membrane proteins using the FUGUE alignment program. On average, in the 10-25% sequence identity range, alignments are improved by 28 correctly aligned residues compared with alignments made using FUGUE's default substitution tables. Our alignments also lead to improved structural models.

abstract = {The SLoop database of supersecondary fragments, first described by Donate et al. (Protein Sci., 1996, 5, 2600-2616), contains protein loops, classified according to structural similarity. The database has recently been updated and currently contains over 10 000 loops up to 20 residues in length, which cluster into over 560 well populated classes. The database can be found at http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/sloop. In this paper, we identify conserved structural features such as main chain conformation and hydrogen bonding. Using the original approach of Rufino and co-workers (1997), the correct structural class is predicted with the highest SLoop score for 35% of loops. This rises to 65% by considering the three highest scoring class predictions and to 75% in the top five scoring class predictions. Inclusion of residues from the neighbouring secondary structures and use of substitution tables derived using a reduced definition of secondary structure increase these prediction accuracies to 58, 78 and 85%, respectively. This suggests that capping residues can stabilize the loop conformation as well as that of the secondary structure. Further increases are achieved if only well-populated classes are considered in the prediction. These results correspond to an average loop root mean square deviation of between 0.4 and 2.6 A for loops up to five residues in length.},

abstract = {Release of the malaria merozoite from its host erythrocyte (egress) and invasion of a fresh cell are crucial steps in the life cycle of the malaria pathogen. Subtilisin-like protease 1 (SUB1) is a parasite serine protease implicated in both processes. In the most dangerous human malarial species, Plasmodium falciparum, SUB1 has previously been shown to have several parasite-derived substrates, proteolytic cleavage of which is important both for egress and maturation of the merozoite surface to enable invasion. Here we have used molecular modelling, existing knowledge of SUB1 substrates, and recombinant expression and characterisation of additional Plasmodium SUB1 orthologues, to examine the active site architecture and substrate specificity of P. falciparum SUB1 and its orthologues from the two other major human malaria pathogens Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi, as well as from the rodent malaria species, Plasmodium berghei. Our results reveal a number of unusual features of the SUB1 substrate binding cleft, including a requirement to interact with both prime and non-prime side residues of the substrate recognition motif. Cleavage of conserved parasite substrates is mediated by SUB1 in all parasite species examined, and the importance of this is supported by evidence for species-specific co-evolution of protease and substrates. Two peptidyl alpha-ketoamides based on an authentic PfSUB1 substrate inhibit all SUB1 orthologues examined, with inhibitory potency enhanced by the presence of a carboxyl moiety designed to introduce prime side interactions with the protease. Our findings demonstrate that it should be possible to develop 'pan-reactive' drug-like compounds that inhibit SUB1 in all three major human malaria pathogens, enabling production of broad-spectrum antimalarial drugs targeting SUB1.},

abstract = {The interaction between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bound epitopes is one of the most important processes in the adaptive human immune response. Several hypotheses on TCR triggering have been proposed. Many of them involve structural and dynamical adjustments in the TCR/peptide/MHC interface. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are a computational technique that is used to investigate structural dynamics at atomic resolution. Such simulations are used to improve understanding of signalling on a structural level. Here we review how MD simulations of the TCR/peptide/MHC complex have given insight into immune system reactions not achievable with current experimental methods. Firstly, we summarize methods of TCR/peptide/MHC complex modelling and TCR/peptide/MHC MD trajectory analysis methods. Then we classify recently published simulations into categories and give an overview of approaches and results. We show that current studies do not come to the same conclusions about TCR/peptide/MHC interactions. This discrepancy might be caused by too small sample sizes or intrinsic differences between each interaction process. As computational power increases future studies will be able to and should have larger sample sizes, longer runtimes and additional parts of the immunological synapse included.},

abstract = {Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are antibody loops that make up the antigen binding site. Here, we show that all CDR types have structurally similar loops of different lengths. Based on these findings, we created length-independent canonical classes for the non-H3 CDRs. Our length variable structural clusters show strong sequence patterns suggesting either that they evolved from the same original structure or result from some form of convergence. We find that our length-independent method not only clusters a larger number of CDRs, but also predicts canonical class from sequence better than the standard length-dependent approach. To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we predicted cluster membership of CDR-L3 sequences from 3 next-generation sequencing datasets of the antibody repertoire (over 1,000,000 sequences). Using the length-independent clusters, we can structurally classify an additional 135,000 sequences, which represents a ���20% improvement over the standard approach. This suggests that our length-independent canonical classes might be a highly prevalent feature of antibody space, and could substantially improve our ability to accurately predict the structure of novel CDRs identified by next-generation sequencing.},

However, we are now beginning to have enough MP structures to justify the development of a homology-based approach specifically for them.\\ We present a MP-specific homology-based coordinate generation method, MEDELLER, which is optimized to build highly reliable core models. The method outperforms the popular structure prediction programme Modeller on MPs. The comparison of the two methods was performed on 616 target-template pairs of MPs, which were classified into four test sets by their sequence identity. Across all targets, MEDELLER gave an average backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.62 \AA{}versus 3.16 \AA{}for Modeller.

These repeats, named on the basis of amino acid conservation of 10 cysteine residues, have been shown to bind members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and are proposed to regulate growth factor signaling. Here we describe the intramolecular disulfide bonding, solution structure, and dynamics of a prototypical chordin-like CR repeat from procollagen IIA (CR(ColIIA)), which has been previously shown to bind TGF-beta1 and bone morphogenetic protein-2. The CR(ColIIA) structure manifests a two sub-domain architecture tethered by a flexible linkage. Initial structures were calculated using RosettaNMR, a de novo prediction method, and final structure calculations were performed using CANDID within CYANA. The N-terminal region contains mainly beta-sheet and the C-terminal region is more irregular with the fold constrained by disulfide bonds. Mobility between the N- and C-terminal sub-domains on a fast timescale was confirmed using NMR relaxation measurements. We speculate that the mobility between the two sub-domains may decrease upon ligand binding. Structure and sequence comparisons have revealed an evolutionary relationship between the N-terminal sub-domain of the CR module and the fibronectin type 1 domain, suggesting that these domains share a common ancestry. Based on the previously reported mapping of fibronectin binding sites for vascular endothelial growth factor to regions containing fibronectin type 1 domains, we discuss the possibility that this structural homology might also have functional relevance.},

abstract = {Antigen presenting cells present processed peptides via their major histocompatibility (MH) complex to the T cell receptors (TRs) of T cells. If a peptide is immunogenic, a signaling cascade can be triggered within the T cell. However, the binding of different peptides and/or different TRs to MH is also known to influence the spatial arrangement of the MH $\alpha$-helices which could itself be an additional level of T cell regulation. In this study, we introduce a new methodology based on differential geometric parameters to describe MH deformations in a detailed and comparable way. For this purpose, we represent MH $\alpha$-helices by curves. On the basis of these curves, we calculate in a first step the curvature and torsion to describe each $\alpha$-helix independently. In a second step, we calculate the distribution parameter and the conical curvature of the ruled surface to describe the relative orientation of the two $\alpha$-helices. On the basis of four different test sets, we show how these differential geometric parameters can be used to describe changes in the spatial arrangement of the MH $\alpha$-helices for different biological challenges. In the first test set, we illustrate on the basis of all available crystal structures for (TR)/pMH complexes how the binding of TRs influences the MH helices. In the second test set, we show a cross evaluation of different MH alleles with the same peptide and the same MH allele with different peptides. In the third test set, we present the spatial effects of different TRs on the same peptide/MH complex. In the fourth test set, we illustrate how a severe conformational change in an $\alpha$-helix can be described quantitatively. Taken together, we provide a novel structural methodology to numerically describe subtle and severe alterations in MH $\alpha$-helices for a broad range of applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Mitotic spindles are primarily composed of microtubules (MTs), generated by polymerization of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Tubulin hetero-dimers [1, 2]. Tubulins undergo a series of protein folding and post-translational modifications in order to fulfill their functions [3, 4]. Defects in Tubulin polymerization dramatically affect spindle formation and disrupt chromosome segregation. We recently described a role for the product of the conserved misato (mst) gene in regulating mitotic MT generation in flies [5], but the molecular function of Mst remains unknown. Here, we use affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to identify interacting partners of Mst in the Drosophila embryo. We demonstrate that Mst associates stoichiometrically with the hetero-octameric Tubulin Chaperone Protein-1 (TCP-1) complex, with the hetero-hexameric Tubulin Prefoldin complex, and with proteins having conserved roles in generating MT-competent Tubulin. We show that RNAi-mediated in��vivo depletion of any TCP-1 subunit phenocopies the effects of mutations in mst or the Prefoldin-encoding gene merry-go-round (mgr), leading to monopolar and disorganized mitotic spindles containing few MTs. Crucially, we demonstrate that Mst, but not Mgr, is required for TCP-1 complex stability and that both the efficiency of Tubulin polymerization and Tubulin stability are drastically compromised in mst mutants. Moreover, our structural bioinformatic analyses indicate that Mst resembles the three-dimensional structure of Tubulin monomers and might therefore occupy the TCP-1 complex central cavity. Collectively, our results suggest that Mst acts as a co-factor of the TCP-1 complex, playing an essential role in the Tubulin-folding processes required for proper assembly of spindle MTs.},

abstract = {Author SummaryIt is widely assumed that knowledge gained in one species can be transferred to another species, even among species that are widely separated on the tree of life. This transfer is often done at the level of proteins under the assumption that if two proteins have similar sequences, they will share similar properties. In this paper, we investigate the validity of this assumption for the case of protein-protein interactions. The transfer of protein interactions across species is a common procedure and it is known to have shortcomings but these are generally ascribed to the incompleteness of protein interaction data. We introduce a framework to take such incomplete information into account, and under its assumptions show that the procedure is unreliable when using sequence-similarity thresholds typically thought to allow the transfer of functional information. Our results imply that, unless using strict definitions of homology, interactions rewire at a rate too fast to allow reliable transfer across species. We urge caution in interpreting the results of such transfers.},

Models of membrane proteins are typically built from template structures with low sequence identity to the target sequence, using a sequence-structure alignment as a blueprint.

Biological membranes have layers of varying hydrophobicity, and membrane proteins have different amino-acid substitution preferences from their soluble counterparts.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ever since the ground-breaking work of Anfinsen et al. in which a denatured protein was found to refold to its native state, it has been frequently stated by the protein fold prediction community that all the information required for protein folding lies in the amino acid sequence. Recent in vitro experiments and in silico computational studies, however, have shown that cotranslation may affect the folding pathway of some proteins, especially those of ancient folds. In this paper aspects of cotranslational folding have been incorporated into a protein structure prediction algorithm by adapting the Rosetta program to fold proteins as the nascent chain elongates. This makes it possible to conduct a pairwise comparison of folding accuracy, by comparing folds created sequentially from each end of the protein.

RESULTS: A single main result emerged: in 94% of proteins analyzed, following the sense of translation, from N-terminus to C-terminus, produced better predictions than following the reverse sense of translation, from the C-terminus to N-terminus. Two secondary results emerged. First, this superiority of N-terminus to C-terminus folding was more marked for proteins showing stronger evidence of cotranslation and second, an algorithm following the sense of translation produced predictions comparable to, and occasionally better than, Rosetta.

CONCLUSIONS: There is a directionality effect in protein fold prediction. At present, prediction methods appear to be too noisy to take advantage of this effect; as techniques refine, it may be possible to draw benefit from a sequential approach to protein fold prediction.},

Insight into the dynamics of their binding can be provided by computational simulations. For these simulations the constant regions are often removed to save runtime as binding occurs in the variable regions. Here we present the first study to investigate the effect of removing the constant regions from antibodies and T-cell receptors on such simulations. We performed simulations of an antibody/antigen and T-cell receptor/MHC system with and without constant regions using 10 replicas of 100 ns of each of the four setups.

abstract = {Knowledge of a protein's three-dimensional native structure is vital
in determining its chemical properties and functionality. However, experimental
methods to determine structure are very costly and time-consuming. Computational
approaches such as folding simulations and structure prediction algorithms
are quicker and cheaper but lack consistent accuracy. This currently restricts
extensive computational studies to abstract protein models. It is thus essential
that simplifications induced by the models do not negate scientific value.
Key to this is the use of thoroughly defined proteinlike sequences. In such
cases abstract models can allow for the investigation of important biological
questions. Here, we present a procedure to generate and classify proteinlike
sequence data sets. Our LatPack tools and the approach in general are applicable
to arbitrary lattice protein models. Identification is based on thermodynamic
kinetic features and incorporates the sequential assembly of proteins by addressing
cotranslational folding. We demonstrate the approach in the widely used unrestricted
3D-cubic HP-model. The resulting sequence set is the first large data set
for this model exhibiting the proteinlike properties required. Our data tools
are freely available and can be used to investigate protein-related problems.},

abstract = {Antibodies are used extensively in medical and biological research. Their complementarity determining regions (CDRs) define the majority of their antigen binding functionality. CDR structures have been intensively studied and classified (canonical structures). Here we show that CDR structure prediction is no different from the standard loop structure prediction problem and predict them without classification. FREAD, a successful database loop prediction technique, is able to produce accurate predictions for all CDR loops (0.81, 0.42, 0.96, 0.98, 0.88 and 2.25 {\AA} RMSD for CDR-L1 to CDR-H3). In order to overcome the relatively poor predictions of CDR-H3, we developed two variants of FREAD, one focused on sequence similarity (FREAD-S) and another which includes contact information (ConFREAD). Both of the methods improve accuracy for CDR-H3 to 1.34 {\AA} and 1.23 {\AA} respectively. The FREAD variants are also tested on homology models and compared to RosettaAntibody (CDR-H3 prediction on models: 1.98 and 2.62 {\AA} for ConFREAD and RosettaAntibody respectively). CDRs are known to change their structural conformations upon binding the antigen. Traditional CDR classifications are based on sequence similarity and do not account for such environment changes. Using a set of antigen-free and antigen-bound structures, we compared our FREAD variants. ConFREAD which includes contact information successfully discriminates the bound and unbound CDR structures and achieves an accuracy of 1.35 {\AA} for bound structures of CDR-H3.},

abstract = {Biological processes are commonly controlled by precise protein-protein interactions. These connections rely on specific amino acids at the binding interfaces. Here we predict the binding residues of such interprotein complexes. We have developed a suite of methods, i-Patch, which predict the interprotein contact sites by considering the two proteins as a network, with residues as nodes and contacts as edges. i-Patch starts with two proteins, A and B, which are assumed to interact, but for which the structure of the complex is not available. However, we assume that for each protein, we have a reference structure and a multiple sequence alignment of homologues. i-Patch then uses the propensities of patches of residues to interact, to predict interprotein contact sites. i-Patch outperforms several other tested algorithms for prediction of interprotein contact sites. It gives 59% precision with 20% recall on a blind test set of 31 protein pairs. Combining the i-Patch scores with an existing correlated mutation algorithm, McBASC, using a logistic model gave little improvement. Results from a case study, on bacterial chemotaxis protein complexes, demonstrate that our predictions can identify contact residues, as well as suggesting unknown interfaces in multiprotein complexes.},

abstract = {The binding site of an antibody is formed between the two variable domains, VH and VL, of its antigen binding fragment (Fab). Understanding how VH and VL orientate with respect to one another is important both for studying the mechanisms of antigen specificity and affinity and improving antibody modelling, docking and engineering. Different VH-VL orientations are commonly described using relative measures such as root-mean-square deviation. Recently, the orientation has also been characterised using the absolute measure of a VH-VL packing angle. However, a single angle cannot fully describe all modes of orientation. Here, we present a method which fully characterises VH-VL orientation in a consistent and absolute sense using five angles (HL, HC1, LC1, HC2 and LC2) and a distance (dc). Additionally, we provide a computational tool, ABangle, to allow the VH–VL orientation for any antibody to be automatically calculated and compared with all other known structures. We compare previous studies and show how the modes of orientation being identified relate to movements of different angles. Thus, we are able to explain why different studies identify different structural clusters and different residues as important. Given this result, we then identify those positions and their residue identities which influence each of the angular measures of orientation. Finally, by analysing VH–VL orientation in bound and unbound forms, we find that antibodies specific for protein antigens are significantly more flexible in their unbound form than antibodies specific for hapten antigens.

@article{Chen2007,
abstract = {Motivation: The Majority Vote approach has demonstrated that protein–protein interactions can be used to predict the structure or function of a protein. In this article we propose a novel method for the prediction of such protein characteristics based on frequencies of pairwise interactions. In addition, we study a second new approach using the pattern frequencies of triplets of proteins, thus for the first time taking network structure explicitly into account. Both these methods are extended to jointly consider multiple organisms and multiple characteristics.
Results: Compared to the standard non-network-based method, namely the Majority Vote method, in large networks our predictions tend to be more accurate. For structure prediction, the Frequency-based method reaches up to 71% accuracy, and the Triplet-based method reaches up to 72% accuracy, whereas for function prediction, both the Triplet-based method and the Frequency-based method reach up to 90% accuracy. Function prediction on proteins without homologues showed slightly less but comparable accuracies. Including partially annotated proteins substantially increases the number of proteins for which our methods predict their characteristics with reasonable accuracy. We find that the enhanced Triplet-based method does not currently yield significantly better results than the enhanced Frequency-based method, suggesting that triplets of interactions do not contain substantially more information about protein characteristics than interaction pairs. Our methods offer two main improvements over current approaches. First, multiple protein characteristics are considered simultaneously, and second, data is integrated from multiple species. In addition, the Triplet-based method includes network structure more explicitly than the Majority Vote and the Frequency-based method.

abstract = {The accurate prediction of protein structure, both secondary and tertiary, is an ongoing problem. Over the years, many approaches have been implemented and assessed. Most prediction algorithms start with the entire amino acid sequence and treat all residues in an identical fashion independent of sequence position. Here, we analyze blind prediction data to investigate whether predictive capability varies along the chain. Free modeling results from recent critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction (CASP) experiments are evaluated; as is the most up-to-date data from EVA, a fully automated blind test of secondary structure prediction servers. The results demonstrate that structure prediction accuracy is dependent on sequence position. Both secondary structure and tertiary structure predictions are more accurate in regions near the amino(N)-terminus when compared with analogous regions near the carboxy(C)-terminus. Eight of 10 secondary structure prediction algorithms assessed by EVA perform significantly better in regions at the N-terminus. CASP data shows a similar bias, with N-terminal fragments being predicted more accurately than fragments from the C-terminus. Two analogous fragments are taken from each model, the N-terminal fragment begins at the start of the most N-terminal secondary structure element (SSE), whereas the C-terminal fragment finishes at the end of the most C-terminal SSE. Each fragment is locally superimposed onto its respective native fragment. The relative terminal prediction accuracy (RMSD) is calculated on an intramodel basis. At a fragment length of 20 residues, the N-terminal fragment is predicted with greater accuracy in 79% of cases.},

abstract = {Motivation: Functional module detection within protein interaction networks is a challenging problem due to the sparsity of data and presence of errors. Computational techniques for this task range from purely graph theoretical approaches involving single networks to alignment of multiple networks from several species. Current network alignment methods all rely on protein sequence similarity to map proteins across species.
Results: Here we carry out network alignment using a protein functional similarity measure. We show that using functional similarity to map proteins across species improves network alignment in terms of functional coherence and overlap with experimentally verified protein complexes. Moreover, the results from functional similarity-based network alignment display little overlap (15%) with sequence similarity-based alignment. Our combined approach integrating sequence and function-based network alignment alongside graph clustering properties offers a 200% increase in coverage of experimental datasets and comparable accuracy to current network alignment methods.

abstract = {Global and co-translational protein folding may both occur in vivo, and understanding the relationship between these folding mechanisms is pivotal to our understanding of protein-structure formation. Within this study, over 1.5 million hydrophobic-polar sequences were classified based on their ability to attain a unique, but not necessarily minimal energy conformation through co-translational folding. The sequence and structure properties of the sets were then compared to elucidate signatures of co-translational folding. The strongest signature of co-translational folding is a reduced number of possible favorable contacts in the amino terminus. There is no evidence of fewer contacts, more local contacts, or less-compact structures. Co-translational folding produces a more compact amino- than carboxy-terminal region and an amino-terminal-biased set of core residues. In real proteins these signatures are also observed and found most strongly in proteins of the alpha/beta structural class of proteins (SCOP) where 71 % have an amino-terminal set of core residues. The prominence of co-translational features in experimentally determined protein structures suggests that the importance of co-translational folding is currently underestimated.},

abstract = {The gap between the number of known protein sequences and structures continues to widen, particularly as a result of sequencing projects for entire genomes. Recently there have been many attempts to generate structural assignments to all genes on sets of completed genomes using fold-recognition methods. We developed a method that detects false positives made by these genome-wide structural assignment experiments by identifying isolated occurrences. The method was tested using two sets of assignments, generated by SUPERFAMILY and PSI-BLAST, on 150 completed genomes. A phylogeny of these genomes was built and a parsimony algorithm was used to identify isolated occurrences by detecting occurrences that cause a gain at leaf level. Isolated occurrences tend to have high e-values, and in both sets of assignments, a sudden increase in isolated occurrences is observed for e-values 10���8 for SUPERFAMILY and 10���4 for PSI-BLAST. Conditions to predict false positives are based on these results. Independent tests confirm that the predicted false positives are indeed more likely to be incorrectly assigned. Evaluation of the predicted false positives also showed that the accuracy of profile-based fold-recognition methods might depend on secondary structure content and sequence length. We show that false positives generated by fold-recognition methods can be identified by considering structural occurrence patterns on completed genomes; occurrences that are isolated within the phylogeny tend to be less reliable. The method provides a new independent way to examine the quality of fold assignments and may be used to improve the output of any genome-wide fold assignment method., When predicting the structure for a protein sequence, a major step is achieved when an evolutionarily related protein with a known structure is identified. This process is called fold recognition, and has been a major force behind improvement in structure prediction. Moreover, fold-recognition techniques have become increasingly important in recent years because of the huge numbers of protein sequences with unknown structures available through sequencing projects on completed genomes. However, all fold-recognition methods tend to produce either a large number of false negatives (at high confidence scores) or a large number of false positives (at low confidence scores). Here we show that the reliability of a fold-recognition technique can be explored by analysing its predictions across a set of completed genomes. We have developed a method that can indicate false positives in these genome-wide assignment sets. The basic idea behind the method is that a fold assignment on a genome is less reliable if the prediction is not observed on evolutionary related genomes. The ability of the method to discriminate false positives is confirmed by independent tests. The method can be used on the output of any genome-wide fold assignment method.},

We find that pairwise interactions between Old proteins are over-represented even when controlling for high degree, and triangle interactions between Old proteins are over-represented even when controlling for pairwise interaction frequencies. There is evidence for negative selection of interactions between Middle-aged and Old proteins within triangles, despite pairwise Middle-Old interactions being common. Most triangles consist solely of vertices with high degree. Our findings point towards an architecture of the yeast PIN that is highly heterogeneous, having connected clumps which contain a large number of interacting Old proteins along with selective age-dependent interaction patterns.

Several antibody modelling pipelines exist, but no freely available methods currently model nanobodies, provide estimates of expected model accuracy, or highlight potential issues with the antibody's experimental development. Here, we describe our automated antibody modelling pipeline, ABodyBuilder, designed to overcome these issues. The algorithm itself follows the standard four steps of template selection, orientation prediction, complementarity-determining region (CDR) loop modelling, and side chain prediction. ABodyBuilder then annotates the 'confidence' of the model as a probability that a component of the antibody (e.g., CDRL3 loop) will be modelled within a root-mean square deviation threshold. It also flags structural motifs on the model that are known to cause issues during in vitro development.

abstract = {Author SummaryProteins are the molecular workers of the cell. They are formed from a string of amino acids which folds into an elaborate three-dimensional structure. While there is a relationship between a protein's sequence and its structure this relationship is highly complex and not fully understood. Protein structures tend to evolve differently to their sequences. They are far more conserved so tend to change slower. The aim of this paper was to identify trends in the way that protein structures evolve, rather than adapting models of sequence evolution. To do this we have provided a database of ages for structural superfamilies. These ages are robust to drastic differences in the evolutionary assumptions underlying their estimation and can be used to study differences between populations of proteins. For example, we have compared newly evolved structures against those with a long evolutionary history and found that, overall, a shorter evolutionary history corresponds to a less elaborate structure. We have also demonstrated here how these ages can be used to compare particular structural motifs present in a large number of protein structures and have shown that the jelly roll motif is significantly younger than the greek key.},

@article{Hamer2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemotaxis is the process by which motile bacteria sense their chemical environment and move towards more favourable conditions. Escherichia coli utilises a single sensory pathway, but little is known about signalling pathways in species with more complex systems.
RESULTS: To investigate whether chemotaxis pathways in other bacteria follow the E. coli paradigm, we analysed 206 species encoding at least 1 homologue of each of the 5 core chemotaxis proteins (CheA, CheB, CheR, CheW and CheY). 61 species encode more than one of all of these 5 proteins, suggesting they have multiple chemotaxis pathways. Operon information is not available for most bacteria, so we developed a novel statistical approach to cluster che genes into putative operons. Using operon-based models, we reconstructed putative chemotaxis pathways for all 206 species. We show that cheA-cheW and cheR-cheB have strong preferences to occur in the same operon as two-gene blocks, which may reflect a functional requirement for co-transcription. However, other che genes, most notably cheY, are more dispersed on the genome. Comparison of our operons with shuffled equivalents demonstrates that specific patterns of genomic location may be a determining factor for the observed in vivo chemotaxis pathways. We then examined the chemotaxis pathways of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Here, the PpfA protein is known to be critical for correct partitioning of proteins in the cytoplasmically-localised pathway. We found ppfA in che operons of many species, suggesting that partitioning of cytoplasmic Che protein clusters is common. We also examined the apparently non-typical chemotaxis components, CheA3, CheA4 and CheY6. We found that though variants of CheA proteins are rare, the CheY6 variant may be a common type of CheY, with a significantly disordered C-terminal region which may be functionally significant.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that many bacterial species potentially have multiple chemotaxis pathways, with grouping of che genes into operons likely to be a major factor in keeping signalling pathways distinct. Gene order is highly conserved with cheA-cheW and cheR-cheB blocks, perhaps reflecting functional linkage. CheY behaves differently to other Che proteins, both in its genomic location and its putative protein interactions, which should be considered when modelling chemotaxis pathways.},

abstract = {Motivation. Loops are often vital for protein function, however, their irregular structures make them difficult to model accurately. Current loop modelling algorithms can mostly be divided into two categories: knowledge-based, where databases of fragments are searched to find suitable conformations and ab initio, where conformations are generated computationally. Existing knowledge-based methods only use fragments that are the same length as the target, even though loops of slightly different lengths may adopt similar conformations. Here, we present a novel method, Sphinx, which combines ab initio techniques with the potential extra structural information contained within loops of a different length to improve structure prediction.
Results. We show that Sphinx is able to generate high-accuracy predictions and decoy sets enriched with near-native loop conformations, performing better than the ab initio algorithm on which it is based. In addition, it is able to provide predictions for every target, unlike some knowledge-based methods. Sphinx can be used successfully for the difficult problem of antibody H3 prediction, outperforming RosettaAntibody, one of the leading H3-specific ab initio methods, both in accuracy and speed.
Sphinx is available at http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sphinx.

In C. elegans, the onset of centriole formation requires notably the proteins SAS-5 and SAS-6, which have functional homologs across eukaryotic evolution. Whereas the molecular architecture of SAS-6 and its role in initiating centriole formation are well understood, the mechanisms by which SAS-5 and its relatives function is unclear. Here, we combine biophysical and structural analysis to uncover the architecture of SAS-5 and examine its functional implications in vivo. Our work reveals that two distinct self-associating domains are necessary to form higher-order oligomers of SAS-5: a trimeric coiled coil and a novel globular dimeric Implico domain. Disruption of either domain leads to centriole duplication failure in worm embryos, indicating that large SAS-5 assemblies are necessary for function in vivo.},

abstract = {We review fold usage on completed genomes to explore protein structure evolution. The patterns of presence or absence of folds on genomes gives us insights into the relationships between folds, the age of different folds and how we have arrived at the set of folds we see today. We examine the relationships between different measures which describe protein fold usage, such as the number of copies of a fold per genome, the number of families per fold, and the number of genomes a fold occurs on. We obtained these measures of fold usage by searching for the structural domains on 157 completed genome sequences from all three kingdoms of life. In our comparisons of these measures we found that bacteria have relatively more distinct folds on their genomes than archaea. Eukaryotes were found to have many more copies of a fold on their genomes. If we separate out the different fold classes, the alpha/beta class has relatively fewer distinct folds on large genomes, more copies of a fold on bacteria and more folds occurring in all three kingdoms simultaneously. These results possibly indicate that most alpha/beta folds originated earlier than other folds. The expected power law distribution is observed for copies of a fold per genome and we found a similar distribution for the number of families per fold. However, a more complicated distribution appears for fold occurrence across genomes, which strongly depends on fold class and kingdom. We also show that there is not a clear relationship between the three measures of fold usage. A fold which occurs on many genomes does not necessarily have many copies on each genome. Similarly, folds with many copies do not necessarily have many families or vice versa.},

Computational techniques such as antibody-antigen docking hold the potential to facilitate the screening process by rapidly providing a list of initial poses that approximate the native complex.
Results: We have developed a new method to identify the epitope region on the antigen, given the structures of the antibody and the antigen���EpiPred. The method combines conformational matching of the antibody-antigen structures and a specific antibody-antigen score. We have tested the method on both a large non-redundant set of antibody-antigen complexes and on homology models of the antibodies and/or the unbound antigen structure. On a non-redundant test set, our epitope prediction method achieves 44% recall at 14% precision against 23% recall at 14% precision for a background random distribution. We use our epitope predictions to rescore the global docking results of two rigid-body docking algorithms: ZDOCK and ClusPro. In both cases including our epitope, prediction increases the number of near-native poses found among the top decoys.

abstract = {Kinases can switch between active and inactive conformations of the ATP/Mg(2+) binding motif DFG, which has been explored for the development of type I or type II inhibitors. However, factors modulating DFG conformations remain poorly understood. We chose CDK2 as a model system to study the DFG in-out transition on a target that was thought to have an inaccessible DFG-out conformation. We used site-directed mutagenesis of key residues identified in structural comparisons in conjunction with biochemical and biophysical characterization of the generated mutants. As a result, we identified key residues that facilitate the DFG-out movement, facilitating binding of type II inhibitors. However, surprisingly, we also found that wild type CDK2 is able to bind type II inhibitors. Using protein crystallography structural analysis of the CDK2 complex with an aminopyrimidine-phenyl urea inhibitor (K03861) revealed a canonical type II binding mode and the first available type II inhibitor CDK2 cocrystal structure. We found that the identified type II inhibitors compete with binding of activating cyclins. In addition, analysis of the binding kinetics of the identified inhibitors revealed slow off-rates. The study highlights the importance of residues that may be distant to the ATP binding pocket in modulating the energetics of the DFG-out transition and hence inhibitor binding. The presented data also provide the foundation for a new class of slow off-rate cyclin-competitive CDK2 inhibitors targeting the inactive DFG-out state of this important kinase target.},

abstract = {In stochastic sensing, the association and dissociation of analyte molecules is observed as the modulation of an ionic current flowing through a single engineered protein pore, enabling the label-free determination of rate and equilibrium constants with respect to a specific binding site. We engineered sensors based on the staphylococcal $\alpha$-hemolysin pore to allow the single-molecule detection and characterization of protein kinase���peptide interactions. We enhanced this approach by using site-specific proteolysis to generate pores bearing a single peptide sensor element attached by an N-terminal peptide bond to the trans mouth of the pore. Kinetics and affinities for the Pim protein kinases (Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were measured and found to be independent of membrane potential and in good agreement with previously reported data. Kinase binding exhibited a distinct current noise behavior that forms a basis for analyte discrimination. Finally, we observed unusually high association rate constants for the interaction of Pim kinases with their consensus substrate Pimtide (���107 to 108 M���1���s���1), the result of electrostatic enhancement, and propose a cellular role for this phenomenon.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: This study presents a novel investigation of the effect of kinetic control on cotranslational protein folding. We demonstrate the effect using simple HP lattice models and show that the cotranslational folding of proteins under kinetic control has a significant impact on the final conformation. Differences arise if nature is not capable of pushing a partially folded protein back over a large energy barrier. For this reason we argue that such constraints should be incorporated into structure prediction techniques. We introduce a finite surmountable energy barrier which allows partially formed chains to partly unfold, and permits us to enumerate exhaustively all energy pathways. RESULTS: We compare the ground states obtained sequentially with the global ground states of designing sequences (those with a unique global ground state). We find that the sequential ground states become less numerous and more compact as the surmountable energy barrier increases. We also introduce a probabilistic model to describe the distribution of final folds and allow partial settling to the Boltzmann distribution of states at each stage. As a result, conformations with the highest probability of final occurrence are not necessarily the ones of lowest energy. AVAILABILITY: Software available on request.},

The general architecture of all antibodies is very similar, but they contain a hypervariable region which allows millions of antibody variants to exist, each of which can bind to different molecules. This binding malleability means that antibodies are an increasingly important category of biopharmaceuticals and biomarkers. We present Antibody i-Patch, a method that annotates the most likely antibody residues to be in contact with the antigen. We show that our predictions correlate with energetic importance and thus we argue that they may be useful in guiding mutations in the artificial affinity maturation process. Using our predictions as constraints for a rigid-body docking algorithm, we are able to obtain high-quality results in minutes. Our annotation method and re-scoring system for docking achieve their predictive power by using antibody-specific statistics.

abstract = {Helix kinks are a common feature of $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins, but are thought to be rare in soluble proteins. In this study we find that kinks are a feature of long $\alpha$-helices in both soluble and membrane proteins, rather than just transmembrane $\alpha$-helices. The apparent rarity of kinks in soluble proteins is due to the relative infrequency of long helices (���20 residues) in these proteins. We compare length-matched sets of soluble and membrane helices, and find that the frequency of kinks, the role of Proline, the patterns of other amino acid around kinks (allowing for the expected differences in amino acid distributions between the two types of protein), and the effects of hydrogen bonds are the same for the two types of helices. In both types of protein, helices that contain Proline in the second and subsequent turns are very frequently kinked. However, there are a sizeable proportion of kinked helices that do not contain a Proline in either their sequence or sequence homolog. Moreover, we observe that in soluble proteins, kinked helices have a structural preference in that they typically point into the solvent.

abstract = {Membrane proteins (MPs) have become a major focus in structure prediction, due to their medical importance. There is, however, a lack of fast and reliable methods that specialize in the modeling of MP loops. Often methods designed for soluble proteins (SPs) are applied directly to MPs. In this article, we investigate the validity of such an approach in the realm of fragment-based methods. We also examined the differences in membrane and soluble protein loops that might affect accuracy. We test our ability to predict soluble and MP loops with the previously published method FREAD. We show that it is possible to predict accurately the structure of MP loops using a database of MP fragments (0.5-1 {\AA} median root-mean-square deviation). The presence of homologous proteins in the database helps prediction accuracy. However, even when homologues are removed better results are still achieved using fragments of MPs (0.8-1.6 {\AA}) rather than SPs (1-4 {\AA}) to model MP loops. We find that many fragments of SPs have shapes similar to their MP counterparts but have very different sequences; however, they do not appear to differ in their substitution patterns. Our findings may allow further improvements to fragment-based loop modeling algorithms for MPs. The current version of our proof-of-concept loop modeling protocol produces high-accuracy loop models for MPs and is available as a web server at http://medeller.info/fread.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interfaces hold the key to understanding protein-protein interactions. In this paper we investigated local interaction network patterns beyond pair-wise contact sites by considering interfaces as contact networks among residues. A contact site was defined as any residue on the surface of one protein which was in contact with a residue on the surface of another protein. We labeled the sub-graphs of these contact networks by their amino acid types. The observed distributions of these labeled sub-graphs were compared with the corresponding background distributions and the results suggested that there were preferred chemical patterns of closely packed residues at the interface. These preferred patterns point to biological constraints on physical proximity between those residues on one protein which were involved in binding to residues which were close on the interacting partner. Interaction interfaces were far from random and contain information beyond pairs and triangles. To illustrate the possible application of the local network patterns observed, we introduced a signature method, called iScore, based on these local patterns to assess interface predictions. On our data sets iScore achieved 83.6% specificity with 82% sensitivity.},

abstract = {Loops are irregular structures which connect two secondary structure elements in proteins. They often play important roles in function, including enzyme reactions and ligand binding. Despite their importance, their structure remains difficult to predict. Most protein loop structure prediction methods sample local loop segments and score them. In particular protein loop classifications and database search methods depend heavily on local properties of loops. Here we examine the distance between a loop's end points (span). We find that the distribution of loop span appears to be independent of the number of residues in the loop, in other words the separation between the anchors of a loop does not increase with an increase in the number of loop residues. Loop span is also unaffected by the secondary structures at the end points, unless the two anchors are part of an anti-parallel beta sheet. As loop span appears to be independent of global properties of the protein we suggest that its distribution can be described by a random fluctuation model based on the Maxwell���Boltzmann distribution. It is believed that the primary difficulty in protein loop structure prediction comes from the number of residues in the loop. Following the idea that loop span is an independent local property, we investigate its effect on protein loop structure prediction and show how normalised span (loop stretch) is related to the structural complexity of loops. Highly contracted loops are more difficult to predict than stretched loops.},

However, despite a recent partial reconstitution of the human Augmin complex in vitro, the molecular basis of this recruitment remains unclear. Here, we used immuno-affinity purification of in vivo Augmin from Drosophila and cross-linking/mass spectrometry to identify distance restraints between residues within the eight Augmin subunits in the absence of any other structural information. The results allowed us to predict potential interfaces between Augmin and $\gamma$-TuRC. We tested these predictions biochemically and in the Drosophila embryo, demonstrating that specific regions of the Augmin subunits, Dgt3, Dgt5 and Dgt6 all directly bind the $\gamma$-TuRC protein, Dgp71WD, and are required for the accumulation of $\gamma$-TuRC, but not Augmin, to the mitotic spindle. This study therefore substantially increases our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning MT-dependent MT nucleation.},

abstract = {We present a fast ab initio method for the prediction of local conformations in proteins. The program, PETRA, selects polypeptide fragments from a computer-generated database (APD) encoding all possible peptide fragments up to twelve amino acids long. Each fragment is defined by a representative set of eight straight phi/psi pairs, obtained iteratively from a trial set by calculating how fragments generated from them represent the protein databank (PDB). Ninety-six percent (96%) of length five fragments in crystal structures, with a resolution better than 1.5 A and less than 25% identity, have a conformer in the database with less than 1 A root-mean-square deviation (rmsd). In order to select segments from APD, PETRA uses a set of simple rule-based filters, thus reducing the number of potential conformations to a manageable total. This reduced set is scored and sorted using rmsd fit to the anchor regions and a knowledge-based energy function dependent on the sequence to be modelled. The best scoring fragments can then be optimized by minimization of contact potentials and rmsd fit to the core model. The quality of the prediction made by PETRA is evaluated by calculating both the differences in rmsd and backbone torsion angles between the final model and the native fragment. The average rmsd ranges from 1.4 A for three residue loops to 3.9 A for eight residue loops.},

A large number of computational studies have investigated the structural dynamics of this interaction.

Here we present the first large scale Molecular Dynamics simulation study of this type investigating HLA-B*08:01 in complex with the Epstein-Barr virus peptide FLRGRAYGL and all possible single point mutations (n=172). All simulations were performed with and without the LC 13 T-cell receptor for a simulation time of 100 ns yielding 344 simulations and a total simulation time of 34 400 ns. Our study is two orders of magnitude larger than the average T-cell receptor / peptide / MHC Molecular Dynamics simulation study. This dataset provides reliable insights into alteration in peptide/MHC-I dynamics caused by T-cell receptor presence. We found that simulations in the presence of T-cell receptors have more H-bonds between peptide/MHC; altered flexibility patterns in the MHC helices and the peptide; a lower MHC groove width range; and altered solvent accessible surface areas. This indicates that without a T-cell receptor the MHC binding groove can open and close while T-cell receptor presence inhibits these breathing-like motions.},

Many cancer types show high expression levels of Pim kinases and particularly Pim-1 has been linked to the initiation and progression of the malignant phenotype. In several cancer tissues somatic Pim-1 mutants have been identified. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of Pim-1 kinase. We expressed and purified some of the mutants of Pim-1 kinase that are expressed in cancer tissues and reported in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The point mutations in the variants significantly affect the conformation of the native state of Pim-1. All the mutants, expressed as soluble recombinant proteins, show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and a lower activation energy values for kinase activity. The decreased stability accompanied by an increased flexibility suggests that Pim-1 variants may be involved in a wider network of protein interactions. All mutants bound ATP and ATP mimetic inhibitors with comparable IC50 values suggesting that the studied Pim-1 kinase mutants can be efficiently targeted with inhibitors developed for the wild type protein.},

While this could be a consequence of the incompleteness of interaction data-sets and presence of error, an intriguing prospect is that the process of network evolution is sufficient to erase any evidence of conservation. Here, we aim to test this hypothesis using models of network evolution and also investigate the role of error in the results of network alignment. We devised a distance metric based on summary statistics to assess the fit between experimental and simulated network alignments. Our results indicate that network evolution alone is unlikely to account for the poor quality alignments given by real data. Alignments of simulated networks undergoing evolution are considerably (4 to 5 times) larger than real alignments. We compare several error models in their ability to explain this discrepancy. Our estimates of false negative rates vary from 20 to 60% dependent on whether incomplete proteome sampling is taken into account or not. We also find that false positives appear to affect network alignments little compared to false negatives indicating that incompleteness, not spurious links, is the major challenge for interactome-level comparisons.},

Of these, 52 were up-regulated 2-fold or greater and 42 were down-regulated 2-fold or greater after interferon-$\gamma$/lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Bioinformatics analysis based on publicly available binary protein interaction data produced a putative interaction network of MAPs in activated macrophages.

Annotation of sequence alignments with JOY, to reflect local structural features, proved valuable, both for modifying hypotheses, and for rejecting predictions when the expected pattern of conservation is not observed.

These functions are coordinated by MT-associated proteins (MAPs), which work in concert with each other, binding MTs and altering their properties. We have used a MT cosedimentation assay, combined with 1D and 2D PAGE and mass spectrometry, to identify over 250 MAPs from early Drosophila embryos. We have taken two complementary approaches to analyse the cellular function of novel MAPs isolated using this approach. First, we have carried out an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, identifying 21 previously uncharacterised genes involved in MT organisation. Second, we have undertaken a bioinformatics analysis based on binary protein interaction data to produce putative interaction networks of MAPs. By combining both approaches, we have identified and validated MAP complexes with potentially important roles in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. This study therefore demonstrates that biologically relevant data can be harvested using such a multidisciplinary approach, and identifies new MAPs, many of which appear to be important in cell division., The microtubule cytoskeleton is crucial for many aspects of cell function. A new multidisciplinary study identifies microtubule-associated proteins that are important in cell division.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The binding between a peptide and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most important processes for the induction of an adaptive immune response. Many algorithms have been developed to predict peptide/MHC (pMHC) binding. However, no approach has yet been able to give structural insight into how peptides detach from the MHC.

RESULTS: In this study, we used a combination of coarse graining, hierarchical natural move Monte Carlo and stochastic conformational optimization to explore the detachment processes of 32 different peptides from HLA-A*02:01. We performed 100 independent repeats of each stochastic simulation and found that the presence of experimentally known anchor amino acids affects the detachment trajectories of our peptides. Comparison with experimental binding affinity data indicates the reliability of our approach (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85). We also compared to a 1000���ns molecular dynamics simulation of a non-binding peptide (AAAKTPVIV) and HLA-A*02:01. Even in this simulation, the longest published for pMHC, the peptide does not fully detach. Our approach is orders of magnitude faster and as such allows us to explore pMHC detachment processes in a way not possible with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

abstract = {Loops are the most variable regions of protein structure and are, in general, the least accurately predicted. Their prediction has been approached in two ways, ab initio and database search. In recent years, it has been thought that ab initio methods are more powerful. In light of the continued rapid expansion in the number of known protein structures, we have re-evaluated FREAD, a database search method and demonstrate that the power of database search methods may have been underestimated. We found that sequence similarity as quantified by environment specific substitution scores can be used to significantly improve prediction. In fact, FREAD performs appreciably better for an identifiable subset of loops (two thirds of shorter loops and half of the longer loops tested) than the ab initio methods of MODELLER, PLOP, and RAPPER. Within this subset, FREAD's predictive ability is length independent, in general, producing results within 2A RMSD, compared to an average of over 10A for loop length 20 for any of the other tested methods. We also benchmarked the prediction protocols on a set of 212 loops from the model structures in CASP 7 and 8. An extended version of FREAD is able to make predictions for 127 of these, it gives the best prediction of the methods tested in 61 of these cases. In examining FREAD's ability to predict in the model environment, we found that whole structure quality did not affect the quality of loop predictions.},

The reason for this preference has not been established. An examination of the local environments of asparagine and aspartic acid in protein structures with a resolution better than 1.5 A revealed that their side-chain carbonyls are frequently within 4 A of their own backbone carbonyl or the backbone carbonyl of the previous residue. Calculations using protein structures with a resolution better than 1.8 A reveal that this close contact occurs in more than 80% of cases. This carbonyl-carbonyl interaction offers an energetic sabilization for the partially allowed conformations of asparagine and aspartic acid with respect to all other non-glycyl amino acids. The non-covalent attractive interactions between the dipoles of two carbonyls has recently been calculated to have an energy comparable to that of a hydrogen bond. The preponderance of asparagine in the left-handed alpha-helical region, and in general of aspartic acid and asparagine in the partially allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, may be a consequence of this carbonyl-carbonyl stacking interaction.},

Such annotations are valuable for antibody sequence comparison, protein structure modelling and engineering.

However, currently no publicly available software exists that can apply all the most widely used schemes or for which an executable can be obtained under an open license.

RESULTS: ANARCI is a tool to classify and number antibody and T-cell receptor amino-acid variable domain sequences. It can annotate sequences with the five most popular numbering schemes: Kabat, Chothia, Enhanced Chothia, IMGT and AHo.

abstract = {Translation of mRNA into protein is a unidirectional information flow process. Analysing the input (mRNA) and output (protein) of translation, we find that local protein structure information is encoded in the mRNA nucleotide sequence. The Coding Sequence and Structure (CSandS) database developed in this work provides a detailed mapping between over 4000 solved protein structures and their mRNA. CSandS facilitates a comprehensive analysis of codon usage over many organisms. In assigning translation speed, we find that relative codon usage is less informative than tRNA concentration. For all speed measures, no evidence was found that domain boundaries are enriched with slow codons. In fact, genes seemingly avoid slow codons around structurally defined domain boundaries. Translation speed, however, does decrease at the transition into secondary structure. Codons are identified that have structural preferences significantly different from the amino acid they encode. However, each organism has its own set of ���significant codons'. Our results support the premise that codons encode more information than merely amino acids and give insight into the role of translation in protein folding.},

@article{Saeed2008,
abstract = {Motivation: Protein-protein interactions have proved to be a valuable starting point for understanding the inner workings of the cell. Computational methodologies have been built which both predict interactions and use interaction datasets in order to predict other protein features. Such methods require gold standard positive (GSP) and negative (GSN) interaction sets. Here we examine and demonstrate the usefulness of homologous interactions in predicting good quality positive and negative interaction datasets.
Results: We generate GSP interaction sets as subsets from experimental data using only interaction and sequence information. We can therefore produce sets for several species (many of which at present have no identified GSPs). Comprehensive error rate testing demonstrates the power of the method. We also show how the use of our datasets significantly improves the predictive power of algorithms for interaction prediction and function prediction.
Furthermore, we generate GSN interaction sets for yeast and examine the use of homology along with other protein properties such as localization, expression and function. Using a novel method to assess the accuracy of a negative interaction set, we find that the best single selector for negative interactions is a lack of co-function. However, an integrated method using all the characteristics shows significant improvement over any current method for identifying GSN interactions. The nature of homologous interactions is also examined and we demonstrate that interologs are found more commonly within species than across species.
Conclusion: GSP sets built using our homologous verification method are demonstrably better than standard sets in terms of predictive ability. We can build such GSP sets for several species. When generating GSNs we show a combination of protein features and lack of homologous interactions gives the highest quality interaction sets.

@article{Heytens2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In mammals, oocyte activation at fertilization is thought to be induced by the sperm-specific phospholipase C zeta (PLCzeta). However, it still remains to be conclusively shown that PLCzeta is the endogenous agent of oocyte activation. Some types of human infertility appear to be caused by failure of the sperm to activate and this may be due to specific defects in PLCzeta.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunofluorescence studies showed PLCzeta to be localized in the equatorial region of sperm from fertile men, but sperm deficient in oocyte activation exhibited no specific signal in this same region. Immunoblot analysis revealed reduced amounts of PLCzeta in sperm from infertile men, and in some cases, the presence of an abnormally low molecular weight form of PLCzeta. In one non-globozoospermic case, DNA analysis identified a point mutation in the PLCzeta gene that leads to a significant amino acid change in the catalytic region of the protein. Structural modelling suggested that this defect may have important effects upon the structure and function of the PLCzeta protein. cRNA corresponding to mutant PLCzeta failed to induce calcium oscillations when microinjected into mouse oocytes. Injection of infertile human sperm into mouse oocytes failed to activate the oocyte or trigger calcium oscillations. Injection of such infertile sperm followed by two calcium pulses, induced by assisted oocyte activation, activated the oocytes without inducing the typical pattern of calcium oscillations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate the importance of PLCzeta during fertilization and suggest that mutant forms of PLCzeta may underlie certain types of human male infertility.},

abstract = {CODA, an algorithm for predicting the variable regions in proteins, combines FREAD a knowledge based approach, and PETRA, which constructs the region ab initio. FREAD selects from a database of protein structure fragments with environmentally constrained substitution tables and other rule-based filters. FREAD was parameterized and tested on over 3000 loops. The average root mean square deviation ranged from 0.78 A for three residue loops to 3.5 A for eight residue loops on a nonhomologous test set. CODA clusters the predictions from the two independent programs and makes a consensus prediction that must pass a set of rule-based filters. CODA was parameterized and tested on two unrelated separate sets of structures that were nonhomologous to one another and those found in the FREAD database. The average root mean square deviation in the test set ranged from 0.76 A for three residue loops to 3.09 A for eight residue loops. CODA shows a general improvement in loop prediction over PETRA and FREAD individually. The improvement is far more marked for lengths six and upward, probably as the predictive power of PETRA becomes more important. CODA was further tested on several model structures to determine its applicability to the modeling situation.

abstract = {5-HT3 receptors possess a number of highly conserved proline residues. We changed each of these to alanine, expressed the mutants as homomeric 5-HT3Areceptors in HEK293 cells, and analyzed them with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. Mutation of Pro56, Pro104, Pro123, and Pro170 resulted in ablation of radioligand binding, whereas mutation of Pro257 and Pro301 did not. Only the latter were expressed at the plasma membrane but were non-functional. Thus the former, which are in the N-terminal domain, may be involved in forming correct receptor structure, while those in the transmembrane region (Pro257 and Pro301) are necessary for the function of the protein. To explore the conformational preference (propensity) of these residues we examined the proportion ofcis-prolines and the influence of adjacent residues in known protein structures. 4.7% of prolines in the protein data base were in the cis conformation, and the distribution of amino acids adjacent to cis-prolines was not randomly distributed. Comparison of the proportion of each amino acid residue adjacent to acis-proline revealed that aromatic and bend-facilitating residues were favored while those with $\beta$-branched chains were not. Thus five residues (Gly, Pro, Tyr, Trp, Phe) and three residues (Pro, Tyr, Phe) were found more frequently than expected before and aftercis-prolines respectively, whereas five residues (Val, Ile, Leu, Asp, Thr) and two residues (Asp, Glu) were found less frequently. Of the 20 proline residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit only Pro170 has adjacent residues that are favorable. Mutating these to non-favorable residues resulted in ablation of ligand binding, whereas replacement with alternative favorable residues did not. We therefore propose that Pro170, which is part of the characteristic cys-loop found in this family of proteins, may be in the cis conformation.},

abstract = {High throughput methods for detecting protein interactions require assessment of their accuracy. We present two forms of computational assessment. The first method is the expression profile reliability (EPR) index. The EPR index estimates the biologically relevant fraction of protein interactions detected in a high throughput screen. It does so by comparing the RNA expression profiles for the proteins whose interactions are found in the screen with expression profiles for known interacting and non-interacting pairs of proteins. The second form of assessment is the paralogous verification method (PVM). This method judges an interaction likely if the putatively interacting pair has paralogs that also interact. In contrast to the EPR index, which evaluates datasets of interactions, PVM scores individual interactions. On a test set, PVM identifies correctly 40% of true interactions with a false positive rate of approximately 1%. EPR and PVM were applied to the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP), a large and diverse collection of protein-protein interactions that contains over 8000 Saccharomyces cerevisiae pairwise protein interactions. Using these two methods, we estimate that approximately 50% of them are reliable, and with the aid of PVM we identify confidently 3003 of them. Web servers for both the PVM and EPR methods are available on the DIP website (dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/Services.cgi).},
